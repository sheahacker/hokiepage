<h2>These are my classes this semester.</h2>

	<p>I'm taking 5 classes this semester. They are all for my majors, Creative Writing and Professional and Technical Writing. They are Read and Write English Studies, Creative Writing: Fiction, Intro to World Literature, American Literary History and Writing and Digital Media.</p>

<h3>Read and Write English Studies</h3>
		<p>We are currently reading a novel called Storming Heaven and using it to analyze how it is written and how we can become better writings by studying it.</p>

<h3>Creative Writing: Fiction</h3>
		<p>Taught by one of the best professors I've ever had, in this class we write fiction pieces and work together as a class to edit them and make them the best they can be.</p>

<h3>Intro to World Literature</h3>
	<p>In this online class, we study the historical and aethestic context of many different works of literature from around the world.</p>

<h3>American Literary History</h3>
	<p>We study literary works that date back as early to the Mayflower and the Massachusetts Bay Colony, to works as recent as ones we ready today.</p>

<h3>Writing and Digital Media</h3>
	<p>In this class we have been learning how to work with HTML, and are now beginning to work with Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) to work on websites.</p>
